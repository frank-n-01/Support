# Chart Day

Visualize your daily data in charts. Create and manage your charts intuitively.

1. Create charts and organize them in folders.
2. Input and edit data for each day. Data can be integers or decimals.
3. Write a note on each day's data.
4. If you have a goal, set a target line on the chart.
5. See statistics for the chart data: sum, count, min, max, mean, median.
6. Switch between line/bar chart display modes with the same data.
7. Change the display period (X-axis) and range (Y-axis) of the chart.
8. Sync your chart data with iCloud.
